# Project Name
SCP: Escape from 076-2

## Context and date
Created for Project 5 in C220

## Description
You are a researcher for the SCP foundation, a foundation dedicated to containing anomolous entites. One of these entities is SCP-076-2, aka Able. Able is
a inhumanly strong humanoid who whenever he can, will go on a rampage, killing several SCP staff. You need to escape the facility without being detected by
Able; your life depends on it.

## Implementation
Player can find keys used to open the door to escape.

Player is in first person. Use the mouse to look around, WASD to move, hold Q or E to peak around corners, and hold shift to sprint.

Able will slowly move in the player's direction, but will speed up considerable when the player is in sight of Able.
